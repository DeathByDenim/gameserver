          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The menu on the right lets you build buildings and units. The first
              things you need to build are a Power Plant (gives you power), a
              Infantry building (builds units) and Storage (harvests resources).
            </li>
            <li>
              When you build your Storage, there will be a Miner that comes with
              it. Use this to harvest resources. Resources will look like a forest.
              You can build more harvester from the vehicle building.
            </li>
          </ul>
