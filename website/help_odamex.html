          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use &lt;SPACE&gt; to jump</li>
            <li>Use E to open doors or to respawn if dead</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Connecting</h2>
          <p>While Odamex does have a launcher, if requires that you have DOOM assets available locally. It won't launch the game without it, which means you either need the original game data of open assets such as Freedoom.</p>
          <p>However, if you connect to the game server directly, odamex will download the required assets automatically from the server.</p>
          <p>From the terminal, type:</p>
          <p><tt>odamex -connect {{ site.content.domain_name }} +set cl_name "YourName"</tt></p>
          <p>Of course, substitute &quot;YourName&quot; with the in-game name you want.</p>
