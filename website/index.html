          <h1>About onFOSS-LAN</h1>
          <p>
            onFOSS-LAN is a online, "Free (as Freedom) and Open Source" LAN-Party
            hosted by hribhrib. The goal is to get people together, enjoying the
            art of computer games and having a great time in these days. The FOSS
            community is a place of being open minded and acceptance to all
            different kinds of people with the focus of fully transparent systems
            and protecting individuals. So it does not matter if you are on Windows,
            Mac or Linux and it is also NOT necessary to have a PC MASTERRACE setup
            to run those games.
          </p>
          <p>This concept was originally started at <a href="https://onfoss.hribhrib.at/">hribhrib.at</a></p>
          <h1>Next event</h1>
          <p>Next event is Saturday 19 March 2022, 14:00 UTC<script>d=new Date("Sat, 19 Mar 2022 14:00:00 UTC");document.writeln(" ("+ Intl.DateTimeFormat(undefined, {hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', timeZoneName: 'short'}).format(d) + ")")</script>, see <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I am running a fundraiser to help the people suffering
            from the war in Ukraine &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;. I will match your donation
            (up to $500 total) and additionally, the government of Canada
            &#x1F1E8;&#x1F1E6; will match mine until 18 March. So, that's triple
            the value for any donation you make. It doesn't have to be to the
            Canadian Red Cross, you probably have a local equivalent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-08)</em>: Canada reached the $10M already so they are not
            doubling anymore. I'll still double but this means your amount won't
            count as triple anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-13)</em>: Canada increased the limit to $30M, so
            any donation you make is once again tripled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-14)</em>: Oh, never mind, this goal has already
            been reached. Anyway, I'll still match what you donate!
          </p>
          <p>
            Donations are based on the honour system since dealing with money
            is complicated. Just let me know what you donated and I'll match.
            I'll post the donations here as the come in. You can be anonymous
            if you want or keep the amount secret. Contact me over
            <a href="https://matrix.to/&#35;/@jarno:matrix.jarno.ca">Matrix</a>,
            <a href="mailto:jarno@jarno.ca">e-mail</a> or in the Matrix/XMPP
            channels listed below.

            You can also use this form. Simply don't fill in your name if you
            wish to remain anonymous.
