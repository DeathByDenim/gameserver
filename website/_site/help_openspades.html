          <h2>Getting the game</h2>
          <div class="download"><a href="https://github.com/yvt/openspades/releases">DOWNLOAD</a></div>
                    <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On joining, you will be asked to choose a team and a weapon. If
              you change your mind during play, press L to get back to that
              selection screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the scroll wheel to cycle between your weapons, the shovel
              and the block. The shovel can destroy blocks, the block can build
              walls
            </li>
            <li>
              If you want to see a bigger map, press N. Press N again to make
              the map go away again.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="nonfreeassets">Non-free assets</h2>
          <p>
            OpenSpades contains non-free assets that were copied from the original
            Ace of Spades games. The creators of OpenSpades were unabled to contact
            the authos, so these assets were never released under an open licence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, there is a drop-in replacement for these assets available.
            All models have been recreated under a CC0 licence and the sound effects
            have been replaced by mostly CC0 equivalents with a few exceptions that
            are CC-BY.
          </p>
          <h3>Installation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Download the libre assets: <a href="https://github.com/DeathByDenim/openspades-free-pak/releases/download/latest/pak001-Free.pak">pak001-Free.pak</a></li>
            <li>Find the location of pak000-Nonfree.pak for your OpenSpades installation. For example <tt>/usr/share/openspades/Resources/</tt></li>
            <li>Copy the downloaded pak001-Free.pak to the same location.</li>
            <li>Optionally, delete pak000-Nonfree.pak. It it no longer needed because pak001-Free.pak will overrule all of the content in pak000-Nonfree.pak.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Connecting</h2>
