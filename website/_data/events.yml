            Additionally, there was a fundraiser to help the people suffering
            from the war in Ukraine &#x1F1FA;&#x1F1E6;. I matched your donation
            (up to $500 total) and additionally, the government of Canada
            &#x1F1E8;&#x1F1E6; will match mine until 18 March. So, that's triple
            the value for any donation you make. It doesn't have to be to the
            Canadian Red Cross, you probably have a local equivalent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-08)</em>: Canada reached the $10M already so they are not
            doubling anymore. I'll still double but this means your amount won't
            count as triple anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-13)</em>: Canada increased the limit to $30M, so
            any donation you make is once again tripled.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-14)</em>: Oh, never mind, this goal has already
            been reached. Anyway, I'll still match what you donate!
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>UPDATE (2022-03-19)</em>: Donations are closed. A total amount
            of &euro;40 was collected and the equivalent of CAD 55.64 was
            donated to the Canadian Red Cross.
          </p>
          <p>List of donations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anonymous: &euro;40</li>
