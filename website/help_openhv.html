          <ul>
            <li>
              The menu on the right lets you build buildings and units. The first
              things you need to build are a Power Plant (gives you power), a
              Module (builds units) and Storage (harvests resources).
            </li>
            <li>
              When you build your Storage, there will be a Miner that comes with
              it. Use this to harvest resources. Resources will look like a couple
              of ingots.
            </li>
          </ul>
