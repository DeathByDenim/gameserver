          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There is lots of stuff to build, so at first things will be
              daunting, but worry not, the mode is co-op so you are all
              working together.
            </li>
            <li>Move around with the WASD keys.</li>
            <li>Use the left mouse button to shoot or build. It will build if you select something from the menu in the bottom right, otherwise it will shoot.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Connecting</h2>
          <p>
