          <h4>How to use Mumble</h4>
          <p>
            Mumble is free and open source software that can be download from
            <a href="https://www.mumble.info/downloads/">Mumble.info</a>. It is
            a low-latency voice client that lets you talk to your fellow
            players using your microphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installation, you will need to configure your audio first. The
            helpful audio wizard will guide your through the settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once that is all set up, you can connect to the Mumble server by
            using the mumble link from the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page.
            You should be able to connect and see something like this:
          </p>
          <img src="img/mumble_interface.png" alt="Screenshot of the Mumble interface">
          <p>
            By default, you will be place in the Root, but you can double-click
            on any channel to join. You will most likely want to go to the Lobby,
            however, you can see which channels the other people hang out in. Note
            that there will likely only be people here during the actual event.
          </p>
          <h4>How to use Matrix/Element</h4>
          <p>
            For text-based chatting, there is the Matrix channel. Matrix is a chat
            protocol (amongst other things). To use the Matrix protocol, you will
            need a client to connect to it. One of the most popular ones is called
            Element which you can either download from
            <a href="https://element.io/get-started">element.io</a> or just run in
            your browser. If you don't have an account yet, you will be able to
            create one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you are logged in, you can follow the Matrix link on the
            <a href="index.html">Home</a> page. It will take you to a page
            asking about the application you want to use. If you downloaded
            Element before, click on the Continue button for that. You should
            be able to connect and see something like this:
          </p>
          <img src="img/element_interface.png" alt="Screenshot of the Element interface">
          <p>There are usually people here, even outside of the event.</p>
          <h4>How to use XMPP/Movim</h4>
          <p>
            Another option for text-based chatting is XMPP. It's another protocol,
            like Matrix but you can use it to join the same chat channel as above.
            The two protocols are "bridged" which means that users can simply
            talk to eachother despite using different protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the Matrix protocol, there are also many XMPP chat clients
            available. One of the easier ones it <a href="https://movim.eu/">Movim.eu</a>.
            It allows you to easily create and account if you don't already have
            an XMPP account.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, you can start the web-based client at <a href="https://mov.im">mov.im</a>.
            After logging in, choose &quot;chats&quot; and then click on the big plus symbol.
          </p>
          <img src="img/movim_interface.png" alt="Screenshot of the Mov.im interface">
          <p>
            In the new screen that pops up, you will find &quot;Join a chatroom&quot;
            and then &quot;Join a custom chatroom&quot;. Paste the room name from
            the link on the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page. You can type anything
            you want in the Name field. That's only visible for you as the name
            of this room.
          </p>
