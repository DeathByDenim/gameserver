          <h5>How to use Mumble</h5>
          <p>
            Mumble is free and open source software that can be download from
            <a href="https://www.mumble.info/downloads/">Mumble.info</a>. It is
            a low-latency voice client that lets you talk to your fellow
            players using your microphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installation, you will need to configure your audio first. The
            helpful audio wizard will guide your through the settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once that is all set up, you can connect to the Mumble server by
            using the mumble link from the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page.
            You should be able to connect and see something like this:

          <p>
            By default, you will be place in the Root, but you can double-click
            on any channel to join. You will most likely want to go to the Lobby,
            however, you can see which channels the other people hang out in. Note
            that there will likely only be people here during the actual event.

          <h5>How to use Matrix/Element</h5>
          <p>
            For text-based chatting, there is the Matrix channel. Matrix is a chat
            protocol (amongst other things). To use the Matrix protocol, you will
            need a client to connect to it. One of the most popular ones is called
            Element which you can either download from
            <a href="https://element.io/get-started">element.io</a> or just run in
            your browser. If you don't have an account yet, you will be able to
            create one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you are logged in, you can follow the Matrix link on the
            <a href="index.html">Home</a> page. It will take you to a page
            asking about the application you want to use. If you downloaded
            Element before, click on the Continue button for that. You should
            be able to connect and see something like this:
          </p>
