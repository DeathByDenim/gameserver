          <p>The game does not have a GUI yet. You need to start it from the terminal/command prompt. When you do so, it will create a configs directory with a client.cfg file. You can add your settings to that.</p>
          <p>The AppImage for Linux creates the config file in <tt>~/.config/share/Soldat/Soldat</tt> instead.</p>
          <p>Things you might like to set:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><tt>cl_player_name YourNameGoesHere</tt></li>
            <li><tt>r_fullscreen 1</tt></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the right mouse button to use your jetpack.</li>
            <li>Press Q to switch to your secondary weapon and E to throw grenades.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Connecting</h2>
          <p>Start Soldat by typing:</p>
          <p><tt>./soldat -join {{ site.content.domain_name }}</tt></p>
          <p>You should now be connected. If it doesn't work. Try to connect by IP address instead of domain name.</p>
